# Cybernetic Commons

An experiment in bounded decentralized cooperatives, designed for geo- or domain-scoped collectives. The goal is to provide a minimalistic architecture to bootstrap a near full **Second-Order Cybernetic system** where **collaborative inquiry**, **dialogue**, and **governance** are first-class citizens.

The currently choosen technologies are preliminary and used for starting the exploration around the MVP. Long term goals are to have them pluggable, possibly through a set of slim shims for hooking them up to each other.

It consists of three central components:

1. **Epistemic Commons**: The shared memory space of the system, content addressable.
2. **Consensus Record**: The distributed ledger of all votes that have taken place.
3. **Cybernetic Steward**: Enacts the system's governance by embodying the will of the collective, as recorded in ratified agreements.

## Guiding Lights

> Action is based on understanding</br>
> Understanding comes from previous actions and the interpretation of their effect</br>
> Dialog is our tool to try seeing interactions from several perspective</br>
> and sidestep the need to observe them **all**
>
> Systems should be soil, not structures. Leave that to the gardeners on top.

## Goal

The aim for this project is not to enforce rigid structures or prescribe solutions, but to provide a path where discussion and dialog are simply the best and easiest tools to reach for. Giving simple, but elastic and malleable boundaries to help keep contexts understandable and navigable. The core here is intended to provide the most baseline of functionality for supporting that while remaining flexible enough such that higher order forms might emerge from it.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Seed**: A minimalistic, self-hosted starting point requiring no external governance, only a first initiator. _(Powered by Nix)_
- **Epistemic Commons**: Content-addressable storage for evolving facts and dialogues. _(Powered by IPFS Cluster)_
- **Consensus Record**: Records ratified decisions and system-wide agreements. _(Powered by Tendermint)_
- **Cybernetic Steward**: Executes ratified decisions as operational changes. _(FluxCD atop a minimal Kubernetes stack)_
- **Connectivity Fabric**: Lightweight peer-to-peer or TCP/IP network layer.
- **Identity Mechanics**: Secret-based model initially, using JWT or similar.

### Extension Paths

- **Transferable**: Epistemological wisdom is intended to be shared and integrated, facilitating new births.
- **Interfaces**: Intrinsic and extrinsic multi-modal user and system interaction interfaces.
- **Policies**: Governance modules enforcing social or technical norms.
- **Autonomous Agents**: AI/ML-based facilitators or delegates.
- **Federation Mechanisms**: Pathways for forming inter-cooperative alliances or dealmaking.
- **Collaborations**: Pathways for forming ad-hoc, ephemeral internal collaborative structures.
- **Resource Management**: Consensus and/or policy based administration of pooled resources.

## Inspirations

- Epistemological Humility and dialectical dialogue
- Second-order cybernetic principles
- Git-based distributed collaboration
- Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM)
- GitOps rendering and continuous reconciliation
- Nordic traditions of trust and cooperative governance
